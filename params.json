{"name":"Dart Web Toolkit","tagline":"Dart Web Toolkit (DWT) is a development toolkit for building and optimizing complex browser-based applications inspired by GWT.","body":"[![Build Status](https://drone.io/github.com/akserg/dart_web_toolkit/status.png)](https://drone.io/github.com/akserg/dart_web_toolkit/latest)\r\n\r\n##What is the DWT?\r\n\r\nDWT is a port of GWT written in pure Dart language. You can create a new enterprise level web application fairly quickly with the DWT. DWT has a rich set of widgets, panels and utility classes compatible with GWT, so migration from an existing Java web applications to the Dart will be faster and easier. You can use your existing GWT themes in the DWT.\r\n\r\n##What under the bonnet?\r\n\r\nDWT is a set of libraries:\r\n* __Activity__ library helps organise navigation applications with activities;\r\n* __Animation__ library provides animation support for variety of the DWT components;\r\n* __Core__ library contains a small number of core classes;\r\n* __Data__ library contains classes for working with the data;\r\n* __Editor__ library helps editing bean-like objects;\r\n* __Event__ library sharing both browser and non-browser events, adapters and event handlers;\r\n* __Http__ library helps to build HTTP requests;\r\n* __I18n__ library helps with the internalisation, text alignment and direction;\r\n* __Layout__ library knows how laying out a container elements and its children;\r\n* __Place__ library contains classes for working with the bookmark location in the web application;\r\n* __Resource__ library helps to provide access to resources at runtime;\r\n* __Role__ library allows ARIA Accessibility attributes to be added to widgets so that they can be identified by assistive technology;\r\n* __Scheduler__ library provides low-level task scheduling primitives;\r\n* __Text__ library helps organise rendering objects into plain-text form;\r\n* __UI__ library is user-interface objects;\r\n* __Util__ library is a small set of utility classes;\r\n\r\nThe current version (0.3) has a rich set of components:\r\n\r\n###Widgets:\r\n* Button, PushButton and ToggleButton; \r\n* CheckBox and RadioButton;\r\n* Composite;\r\n* NumberBox, DoubleBox and IntegerBox;\r\n* FileUpload;\r\n* Hidden;\r\n* Hyperlink;\r\n* Image;\r\n* InlineHtml, InlineImage and InlineLabel;\r\n* Label;\r\n* List;\r\n* MenuBox and MenuItem;\r\n* TextBox, PasswordTextBoxe and TextArea;\r\n* SimpleCheckBox and SimpleRadioButton;\r\n* Tree;\r\n\r\n###Panels:\r\n* AbsolutePanel;\r\n* CaptionPanel;\r\n* DeckPanel;\r\n* StackPanel and DecoratedStackPanel;\r\n* DecoratorPanel;\r\n* DockPanel;\r\n* DecoratedTabBar and DecoratedTabPanel;\r\n* DisclosurePanel;\r\n* FlexTable;\r\n* FlowPanel;\r\n* FocusPanel;\r\n* Frame;\r\n* Grid;\r\n* HorizontalPanel and VerticalPanel;\r\n* HtmlPanel;\r\n* ScrolledPanel;\r\n* SimplePanel;\r\n* TabBar and TabPanel;\r\n\r\n###Layout based panels:\r\n* DockLayoutPanel;\r\n* LayoutPanel;\r\n* SplitLayoutPanel;\r\n* StackLayoutPanel;\r\n* TabLayoutPanel;\r\n\r\n###Popups:\r\n* PopupPanel;\r\n* DialogBox;\r\n\r\nAnimation library helps to organise animation slide, fade or popup effects. Developers can use existing or create new components on them owns.\r\n\r\n##The DWT in action?\r\n\r\nYou can look at the [Dart Web Toolkit Showcase](https://github.com/akserg/dart_web_toolkit_showcase), to see the DWT in actions. For details about what’s inside and the principles on which it is built (and libraries), see the official web site.\r\n\r\n##How to create a brand new web application on the DWT?\r\n\r\n_Note: If you are just beginning to study the Dart language please read the [tutorial](http://www.dartlang.org/docs/tutorials) first. You need to have latest version of the DartEditor with the Dart SDK installed on your computer._ \r\n* Create a new web application `hello_world`.\r\n* Open `pubspec.yaml` and add the Dart Web Toolkit into `Dependencies`:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\ndependencies:\r\n  dart_web_toolkit: \">=0.3.0\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Save `pubspec.yaml` and the DartEditor automatically runs `pub install`, which recursively installs the Dart libraries from the packages in the dependencies list.\r\n* Open `hello_world.html` file from the `web` folder and add a link reference to the Dart Web Toolkit `clean` theme.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" \r\n    href=\"packages/dart_web_toolkit/resource/clean/clean.css\">\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Open `hello_world.dart` and modify it as follows:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nlibrary dwt_hello_world;\r\n\r\nimport 'package:dart_web_toolkit/ui.dart' as ui;\r\n\r\nvoid main() {\r\n    ui.Label label = new ui.Label(\"Hello, World!\");\r\n    ui.RootLayoutPanel.get().add(label);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Check how the application works in Dartium.\r\n* Check how the application works in JavaScript within FireFox or IE.\r\n\r\nCongratulations you have just created your first application on the DWT!\r\n\r\n##What's next?\r\n\r\n* Continue to develop components are not included in current release;\r\n* [UI Binder](https://github.com/akserg/dart_web_toolkit_ui_binder);\r\n* [Theme Roller](https://github.com/akserg/dart_web_toolkit_theme_roller) to create and modify themes;\r\n* [Cell](https://github.com/akserg/dart_web_toolkit_cell);\r\n* [Charts](https://github.com/akserg/dart_web_toolkit_charts);\r\n* [Mobile](https://github.com/akserg/dart_web_tooklit_mobile);\r\n\r\n##Fork the DWT\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to contribute back to the core, you can fork this repository and send a pull request to me, when it is ready.\r\n\r\nIf you are new to Git or GitHub, please read this [guide](https://help.github.com/) first.\r\n\r\n##License\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2012-2013 Sergey Akopkokhyants Licensed under the Apache 2.0 License.\r\n\r\n##Credits\r\n\r\nThis makes use of a lot of ideas from the GWT source code, so big thanks to the Google GWT team!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
